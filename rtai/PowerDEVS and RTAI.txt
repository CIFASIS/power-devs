This a modified version of Ubuntu that includes the PowerDEVS simulator
along with the RTAI kernel and modules.
The distribution is ready to run realtime simulations from the livecd or can be installed as any other Ubuntu.
Care must be taken when developing models to be run in realtime.
For example there can be no Linux syscalls during the simulation (open/read/write) for they ruin the realtime performance, thus Linux syscalls must be restricted to initialization and clean up functions.
PowerDEVS offers some file operations functions that are realtime friendly.
PDFile{Open,Read,Write,Close}.
For more information check the PowerDEVS Utility libraries.
